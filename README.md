## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the disabled properties of button. This is my first project I implemented using the disabled properties of the button and activated back after certain conditions has been met to delete some properties from the DOM.

To see the code snippets, see below:

```html
<button disabled>Reset</button>
```

```css
button:disabled {
  color: #666;
  background-color: gray;
}
```

```js
reset.disabled = true;
```
